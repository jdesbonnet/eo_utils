For some applications it is necessary to acquire aerial or EO products only along a corridor (eg road or hedgerow).
Some providers allow polygon AOIs but require that the polygon is simply-connected (ie no holes). 

This script takes a LineString network, applies a configurable buffer to the LineStrings and cuts channels when necessary to eliminate holes.
